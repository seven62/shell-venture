        This gallery is interesting. You see old class photos, 
        trophy cases, all memorabilia from eras past. Even a 
        bronze statue in the corner. 


        There's a lot to explore here, but it also seems to have 
        reached a DEAD END. When you're done looking around, head 
        back to the ENTRANCE. Remember, to back track one directory
        you type:

            $ cd ..


        Any items laying around you can interact with?

TIP:
- If you are mapping your progress, you can see the full path of your 
  current location (working dir) by running:  `pwd`
