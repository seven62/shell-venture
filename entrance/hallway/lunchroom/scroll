    There are some things in a room (folder) that you can interact 
    with. These encounters are called "shell scripts" and end with 
    a "*" when listed.

    They are run by typing `./` followed by the name of the 
    encounter. For example, to interact with an item:


        $ ./envelope


    The . (dot) means *HERE*, and the name of the script makes 
    the code run. This is known as a relative path, with the `.` 
    representing the current room (folder).

    You may have left an item in the previous room. ;) Go back 
    to the previous directory with two dots, which means 
    *take a step back*.


        $ cd ..         move back one step
        $ cd ../..      move back two steps
        $ cd ../../..   move back three steps

TIP:
- sometimes your screen can get messy and make things confusing
- run the `clear` command any time to unclutter and continue
- the `ctrl + l` keyboard shortcut does the same thing!
