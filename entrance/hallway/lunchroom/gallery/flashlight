        Wandering into the lunchroom, you see no signs of recent 
        activity. But all of a sudden you hear a commotion from 
        a doorway in the back of the lunchroom. Time to reach for 
        the closest item you could use as a weapon!

        You have found a solid black **Flashlight**! Add it 
        to your inventory:


            export BAG=flashlight,\$BAG


        Remember, you can check your inventory with:


            echo \${BAG}
