        been filtering through the hallway windows. The strange 
        darness is heavy now, making it difficult to tell what 
        is a doorway and what is an object. 
        
        The `ls` command can be enhanced by adding an additonal
        arguement or "flag":


            ls -F


        Now that you're getting more visual detail, let's cover
        what it's showing you:
        
        - directories (the rooms) will end with a "/"   
            - example: lunchroom/
        
        - encounters (scripts) end with a "*"           
            - example: envelope*


----------------------------------------------------------------
TIP:
- you can avoid having to type `ls -F` every time by running:

    alias ls='ls -F'

- this creates a command ALIAS. Now typing `ls` will run `ls -F`
