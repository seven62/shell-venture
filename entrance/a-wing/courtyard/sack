        There's a **Paper Sack** on the ground, probably
        fell off of some poor adventurer.


EOF

printf "Do you want to take the sack?  Y/n:  "

read RESP

if [ "$RESP" = "y" -o "$RESP" = "Y" ];then
    cat << EOF

        As you take the sack, you find a Animal Crakers. 
        The good ones too, with pink icing on them! They're 
        probably someone's favorite emergency lunchtime 
        rations. Add these SNACKS to your inventory:  


            export BAG=snacks,\${BAG}


        Remember, you can check your inventory with:  

            echo \$BAG
