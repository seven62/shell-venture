    This place is a strange mix of really old stuff, right next to 
    some very expensive tech. There are top notch security cameras, 
    and strangely, this parchment scroll you're reading now.


    To take a look at your surroundings, type:      ls
    To move around into various folders, type:      cd <directory>


    Try looking around and exploring this room and any items in it. 
    Then, move into the next one.

    EXAMPLES:

        $ ls
        $ cat computer
        $ cd hallway


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
TIP:
- remember to type `ls` when you move into the next room!
- ALWAYS auto-complete command by using the <TAB> key. Ex:
  - cat f<TAB> - autofills full filename
