    Once the thriving Math & Science room (it says so, on the wall), D3 
    is filled with computers, 3-D printers, robotics parts, and various
    other gizmos. The room is now hauntingly quiet.


    Cobwebs in every corner...


    You start to feel drowsy, and need something to wake 
    you up. But how would you learn how to find something
    that's not right in this room???
