            There is a large printer at the center of
            the north wing corridor. There's a piece 
            of paper, labeled `page1` on top of it.

            You really need something to write down 
            all the interesting things you encounter 
            (descriptions, passwords, etc.).

            Perhaps if you make SEVERAL COPIES of 
            `page1`, you can form a notebook to 
            keep in your bag.
            
            Try a command to CoPy and name objects!
